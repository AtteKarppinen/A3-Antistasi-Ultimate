In order to get .csv files, download the .xlsx version of the sheet and place it in xlsx2csv. Read the README.md in that folder.

To parse the data, place your .csv files in the /csv directory. Then run `parser.py` in root.
You can retrieve the data in /output.

For cleaning you can use `cleanup.py` or do it manually.
