You should probably make sure to download the .xlsx version of the sheet yourself, that way you know it's up to date.

In order to get .csv files, download the .xlsx version of the sheet and place it in xlsx2csv. Run the python file with these parameters: `input.xlsx output.csv -a`
Once ran, it should place all the csv files in a `output.csv` folder.

Typically it is ran with these parameters:
`BlackMarketVehicles.xlsx BlackMarketVehicles.csv -a`
