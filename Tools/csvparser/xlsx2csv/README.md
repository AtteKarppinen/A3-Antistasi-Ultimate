You should probably make sure to download the xlsx sheet yourself, that way you know it's up to date.

In order to get .csv files, download the xlsx version of the sheet and place it in xlsx2csv. Run the python file with these parameters: `Name_Of_xlsx_File.xlsx Name_Of_xlsx_File.csv -a`
Once ran, it should place all the csv files in a BlackMarketVehicles.csv folder.
